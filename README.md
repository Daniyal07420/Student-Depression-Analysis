# 📊 Project Description – Student Mental Health & Depression Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project presents a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of student mental health, focusing on depression indicators, lifestyle habits, academic pressure, and overall well-being. Using Power BI, the dashboard transforms raw data into meaningful insights through interactive visualizations, dynamic KPIs, and correlation-based analysis.

The goal of this project is to understand how multiple factors—such as academic pressure, study satisfaction, financial stress, sleep patterns, diets, and family mental history—contribute to mental health challenges faced by students. This dashboard is designed with a professional UI, making it suitable for real-world use within academic institutions, mental health organizations, and HR screening processes.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To uncover meaningful relationships between key variables such as:

Depression vs Academic Pressure

Depression vs Study Satisfaction

Depression vs Financial Stress

Family History of Mental Illness vs Gender

To present a clean, interactive, and professional dashboard that supports data-based decision-making.
